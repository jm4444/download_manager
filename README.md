A program for managing files in the Downloads folder on Windows

Place the program in a folder of your choosing, then place that folder inside of the Downloads folder on your system.
For Example, the path to your file could look like: "../Downloads/Download_Manager_Folder/download_manager.py

Create these folders in your Downloads folder:
  * "Installers" - files used to install programs
  * "Images" - image files
  * "MicrosoftOffice Files" - Microsoft Word, Powerpoint, and Excel files
  * "PDFs" - for PDF files
  * "Misc" - for any files that do not fit into any of the above categories
  
To rename these folders or to create your own, simple place the new/renamed folder in the Downloads folder.
Then go into the program and change the file extensions and paths accordingly.

To run the program, navigate to the program's location in the terminal, and run it using:
  > \> python download_manager.py

After this your files will all be sorted accordingly.
